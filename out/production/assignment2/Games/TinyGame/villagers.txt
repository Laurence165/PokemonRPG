Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon! My name is Oak! People call me the Pokémon Prof!
This world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon!
For some people, Pokémon are pets. Other use them for fights. Myself… I study Pokémon as a profession.
Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with Pokémon awaits! Let's go!
You need your own Pokémon for your protection. I know! Here, come with me!
Do you see that ball on the table? It's called a Poké Ball. It holds a Pokémon inside. You may have it! Go on, take it!
